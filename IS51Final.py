There will be a list of student grades from the final exam. The program will display
the number of grades. It will also display the average grade as well as displaying 
the percentage of grades that are abover the average. The program will count how many
grades are above the average grade of 83.25. It will take this number and divide by the 
total amount of tests graded. This will equal the percentage of grades above the average.
To find the percentage of grades above average we must divide the amount of scores above
the average score by the amount of scores below the average.
